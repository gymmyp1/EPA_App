# Getting the Code

Go ahead and download Android Studio (from browser) and Xcode (App Store or Managed Software Center).
Follow the Dependencies and installation [guide](https://code.ornl.gov/6tm/ruby_epa_app/wikis/%232-Dependencies-and-Installation).

1) Sign in to Git lab: https://code.ornl.gov/users/sign_in

2) In Git Lab the project is named: Marquard, Talon A / ruby_epa_app

Create a new directory on your local machine and navigate to it inside a terminal.

To set up this directory to access Git Lab:
```
git init
git remote add origin https://code.ornl.gov/6tm/ruby_epa_app
git fetch --all
```
To receive all the files in the master branch:
`git pull origin master`

`ls` to see if you have files now.
For information on how to set up your personal branch, see my [GitLab cheatsheet](https://code.ornl.gov/6tm/ruby_epa_app/wikis/gitlab-cheatsheet).
