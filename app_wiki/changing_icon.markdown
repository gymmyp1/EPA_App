### The Problem

You're supposed to run `ionic resources` from inside your working ionic directory, but it was giving me a server error. So I found someone who wrote a generator! I've included the executable in the resources folder, but if you need a different version, here's their [GitHub](https://github.com/harshzalavadiya/ionic-resource-generator).

1. Update your icon.png (must be 1024 x 1024 px) and splash.png (must be 2732 x 2732 px) in root of resources folder. The names have to match too.

2. Open terminal, navigate to your working ionic directory/resources and run ionic-resource-generator generate 🎉
